\subsection{Première sous partie}



\section{Quelques formules}
Remarque : $\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}$ sera noté $\partial_x F$


Équation de la chaleur avec terme de production:

\begin{equation}
\rho C_p \partial_t T = div ( \lambda \vec{grad}(T))  + P
\end{equation}

À 1d ca devient 

\begin{equation}
\rho C_p \partial_t T = \partial_x ( \lambda \partial_x T)  + P
\end{equation}


 À 3D en symétrie sphérique ça devient :

\begin{equation}
\rho C_p \partial_t T = \frac{1}{r^2} \partial_r ( \lambda r^2 \partial_r T)  + P
\end{equation}

En unités adimensionnées 3D en symétrie sphérique ça devient :
\begin{align}
r' &= r/R_{T} \\
t' &= \frac{\lambda}{\rho C_p R_{T}^2} \\
p &= \frac{P R_{T}^2 }{ \lambda}\\
\partial_{t'}T &= \frac{1}{r'^2} \partial_{r'} ({r'}^2 \partial_{r'} T)  + p
\end{align}




\subsection{discretisation}

On note $T(t,r_i) $ : $  T^t_i$
\begin{align}
\partial_t T &\rightarrow  \frac{T^{t+1}_r - T^{t+1}_r}{\Delta t}\\
\partial_r T &\rightarrow  \frac{T^t_{i+1/2} - T^{t}_{i-1/2}}{\Delta r} \\
\frac{1}{r^2}\partial_r (r^2 \partial_r T ) &\rightarrow \frac{1}{r^2_i \Delta r} r^2_{i+1/2}\frac{T^t_{i+1} - T^{t}_{i}}{\Delta r} + r^2_{i+1/2}\frac{T^t_{i-1} - T^{t}_{i}}{\Delta r}
\end{align}
